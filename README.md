# Stock Picker Algorithm

The "Stock Picker Algorithm" is a Ruby function that helps determine the best days to buy and sell stocks for maximum profit. Given an array of stock prices, the function iterates over each day, comparing it with subsequent days to calculate potential profits. It identifies the combination of buy and sell days that yields the highest profit.

The algorithm starts by initializing variables to keep track of the best days to buy and sell, as well as the maximum profit. It then iterates over each day in the prices array, considering it as a potential buying day. For each buying day, it iterates over the subsequent days to calculate the profit if the stock is sold on that day. If the potential profit is greater than the current maximum profit, the best buy and sell days are updated accordingly.

The example usage showcases how to utilize the "Stock Picker Algorithm" with a sample array of stock prices. By calling the `stock_picker` function with the prices array, it returns an array containing the best buy and sell days, represented as indices in the prices array.

With the "Stock Picker Algorithm," investors and traders can make informed decisions on when to buy and sell stocks, optimizing their profits in the dynamic stock market. This algorithmic approach provides a valuable tool for analyzing historical price data and formulating effective trading strategies.
